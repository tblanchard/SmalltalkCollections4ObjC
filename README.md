## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

SmalltalkCollections is meant to be available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "SmalltalkCollections"
```

but I am not at all certain I have the pod manifest correct.  So downloading and just adding the files to your project might be your best bet.  Experienced pod builders that want to help - pull requests would be super welcome.
